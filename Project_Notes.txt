I am working on the very beginnings, how I will input a database to be processed. 
Since my databases only require timestamps, I will feed the simulation a CSV of data for which
it will filter out the timestamp values and store them into a postgresql database with a given name. 
The two arguments that Sim_TSDB takes as of right now are a database name and a csv file. 

Data Set 1 --> https://www.kaggle.com/BGU-CSRC/sherlock/version/1
I will only be using the csv called AllBroadcasts.csv

Data Set 2 -->  https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london#weather_hourly_darksky.csv
I will only be using the CSV called 

Data Set 3 --> https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/hwpu0/any_interest_in_a_data_dump_of_all_e3related_news/
I will only be using the csv called e3feed_search_export.csv these time stamps are in epoch time stamps

I have ingested the ALl broadcast data set. This took a bit more time than expected because I had to do some cleaning.
I wrote a function all_broadcast_ingest_data that ingests it. Now that I have timestamps in the data base, I can start with the 
Inverted index module.
